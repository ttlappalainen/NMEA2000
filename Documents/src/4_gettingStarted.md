  \section secMem Memory requirements

Roughly you need at last 8 kB ram and 40 kB ROM to fullfill all required NMEA2000 features with your own logic. Even requirements can be squeezed I do not prefer to do that to avoid unnecessary issues.

With version 11.06.2017 I measured and got results:

- Approximate ROM 26.9 kB
- Approximate RAM  3.4 kB

This was with simple TemperatureMonitor example. This can be squeezed by
setting:

- Add below to setup() before NMEA2000.Open();
```shell
  NMEA2000.SetN2kCANMsgBufSize(2);  // This may cause loss of received fast packet messages.
  NMEA2000.SetN2kCANSendFrameBufSize(15); // This may cause loss of important information to other bus devices.
```

- Defining ProductInformation to PROGMEM as in BatteryMonitor example.
- Disabling all extra features. See NMEA2000_CompilerDefns.h
- Disable interrupt receiving.

With those setting you can go down to appr. 19 kB ROM and 1.9 kB RAM. So for 2
kB RAM devices like Arduino Uno, there is not much for your own code.

\warning By squeezing memory, library can not fulfill certification requirements anymore.

  \section secHWSet Hardware setup

NMEA2000 is inherited from CAN. Many MCUs like Teensy >3.1, ESP32, Arduino Due has internal
CAN controller. If your MCU does not have internal CAN controller or you need second
external CAN controller, you can use e.g. MCP2515 CAN controller, which is supported by
library (mcp_can).

For final connection to the bus you need CAN bus_transceiver chip. Devices on NMEA2000
bus should be isolated to avoid ground loops. If you take power from NMEA2000
bus and your device is not connected to ground anywhere else, you can use unisolated tranceiver
like MCP2551, MCP2562 or SN65HVD234.
If you instead feed power to your device directly or e.g. use engine own sensors for measuring,
you have to use isolated tranceivers like ISO1050. Remember also use isolated power supply, if you take power from bus and have any unisolated connection to anywhere on your whole system.

Easiest for connecting to NMEA2000 bus is to use some ready shield. For more
information on how to wire everything to the bus please see \ref pageHWSetUp

## Breakout Boards

I prefer isolated connection NMEA2000 bus. See more \ref subsubIso.

For beginner simplest board would be board with MCU (like ESP32 or Teensy 4.0) with isolated transceiver. Unfortunately I have found only one Teensy 4.0 board with unisolated tranceiver. Next simplest is breakout board that fits directly to main board pins, but even those does not exist isolated. But it is not much work to connect 4 wires and use existing isolated board.


### Isolated breakout board

This can be used with any main board having internal CAN controller like Teensy 4.0, 4.1 (or 3.2, 3.5, 3.6 which are at end of life), ESP32 Arduino DUE boards.

Note that there are several different shields for CAN bus available and others may use

\section secHWlib Hardware depended libraries

You need at least Arduino Software 1.8.19 for this sample. I'll expect you are
familiar with Arduino and using libraries. When your Arduino environment is
ready.

- Download [NMEA2000](https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000) library zip.
- Depending of your board download libraries as zip

@note Take care that you use libraries under my Github, when available! Others may not work right
with NMEA2000!

### Teensy 4.0/4.1 boards with internal CAN {#subT4Libraries}

- [NMEA2000_Teensyx](https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000_Teensyx)  library.
- Remember also install [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html) !

CAN library is included to the code so you do not need any extra CAN library with this. NMEA2000_Teensyx
library will replace NMEA2000_teensy library in future. You can already start to use it with
all Teensy boards by forcing it with define (see NMEA2000_CAN.h comment).
  
### Teensy 3.1/3.2 or 3.5/3.6 board with internal CAN

I prefer to move to use libraries as \ref subT4Libraries and force it by define. Old libraries are still as default.

- [NMEA2000_teensy](https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000_teensy) library.  
- [FlexCAN](https://github.com/ttlappalainen/FlexCAN_Library) library.  
- Remember also install [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html) !

NMEA2000_teensy has been originally forked from [NMEA2000_teensy](https://github.com/sarfata/NMEA2000_teensy) contributed
by [Thomas Sarlandie](https://twitter.com/sarfata/)

@note FlexCan library is already included in
[Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html) extension. In order
to use my fork, you have to remove FlexCAN library from  
`C:\Program Files(x86)\Arduino\hardware\teensy\avr\libraries\FlexCAN`.  
Default FlexCAN library does not work right with NMEA2000.  
  
### ESP32 boards  with internal CAN
  
- [NMEA2000_esp32](https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000_esp32) library

ESP32 CAN driver by Thomas Barth has been implemented inside NMEA2000_esp32
so you do not need other drivers for that.

### Arduino Due board with internal CAN

- [NMEA2000_due](https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000_due) library
- [due_can](https://github.com/ttlappalainen/due_can) library

### Pi Pico board with Adafruit CAN PiCowbel hat

- [NMEA2000_pico](https://github.com/forcel0/NMEA2000_PICO) library

### Boards with MCP2515 CAN bus controller (e.g. Arduino Mega, ESP8266)

- [NMEA2000_mcp](https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000_mcp) library.
- [mcp_can](https://github.com/ttlappalainen/CAN_BUS_Shield) library.

You can use mcp_can with boards where you connect MCP2515 CAN bus controller with SPI. You can
also use it as secondary CAN for e.g. Teensy 3.2 or ESP32.

mcp_can library is developed version of original mcp_can library.
This allows also to use 8MHz clock and has been tested with
Maple Mini.  mcp_can library can be originally found on
<https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/CAN_BUS_Shield>, but check library status has all improvements
been implemented to Seeed-Studio. At least 18.09.2017 it was up to date.

### Raspberry Pi

[NMEA2000_socketCAN](https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000_socketCAN) library.

NMEA2000_socketCAN has been originally forked from <https://github.com/thomasonw/NMEA2000_socketCAN>

There is a document [Preparing your Raspberry Pi for the NMEA2000 library.pdf](https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000/blob/master/Documents/Pdf/Preparing%20your%20Raspberry%20Pi%20for%20the%20NMEA2000%20library.pdf) for starting up with RPi.
Hopefully I have time to write more complete document. There is example NMEA2000ToNMEA0183, which
has been tested with RPi 3B.

# Quick Example

Install all libraries to your Arduino IDE (Sketch-Include Library-Add .ZIP library).

- Open `NMEA2000\Examples\TemperatureMonitor`.
- Connect you board to USB and NMEA2000 bus.
- Send sketch to your board.

If you have Multi Function Display (e.g. Garmin GMI-20) on your NMEA2000 bus,
you should see on it's NMEA2000 bus devices new device "Simple temp monitor"
on the list.

Now you are ready to play with your own device. Check also the
`NMEA2000\Examples\ActisenseListener`, which reads all data from NMEA2000 bus and
sends it to PC. `NMEA2000/Examples/ArduinoGateway` allows you to mimic Actisense
NGT-1 and connect e.g. a Raspberry Pi running Signal-K to the NMEA2000 bus with
an Arduino or Teensy.

# Forcing CAN board dependent "driver"

In examples there are simple includes:

```cpp
    #include <Arduino.h>
    #include <NMEA2000_CAN.h>  // This will automatically choose right CAN library and create suitable NMEA2000 object
```

If above can not be used (like with Arduino IDE older than 1.6.6) or you would like to control naming and used "driver", you can manually include necessary files. Specially you need that, if you want to use secondary CAN bus on your system.
