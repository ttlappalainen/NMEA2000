= NMEA2000 -> SeaSmart/NMEA0183 WiFi converter =

 NMEA0183/NMEA2000 library. NMEA2000 -> NMEA0183
 
   Reads messages from NMEA2000 and converts them to SeaSmart
   format and some also to NMEA0183 format and acts as server
   on WiFi network.

   The example is designed for sending N2k data to WiFi in NMEA0183
   and SeaSmart format. You can use this with OpenCPN and various 
   mobile app, which can connect to TCP server and read NMEA0183
   or SeaSmart formatted data.
   
   Example has been tested on ESP32.
   
   Currently you need to define you WiFi settings on the beginning
   of .ino. The plan is to add WiFiManager style configuration.

 To use this example you need install also:
 
   - NMEA2000 library
   
   - NMEA0183 library
   
   - Related CAN libraries.

   - ESP32 environment installed
