NMEA2000 standard type definitions.

This file contains (and must only contain) type definitions of data types
defined in the NMEA2000 standard.  These all have names of the form "DDnnn".
The language of the definitions should follow exactly that of the standard
document from which the information is drawn.  No abbreviated names. No
mangled capitalisation.

The entries here are mostly enums describing bit field types. Where an enum
member has multiple meanings, each meaning is aliased (see tN2kDD0002 for an
example).

This file is included by N2kTypes.h where the standard code names are aliased
into corresponding long names (once again, exactly as described by NMEA).
